Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits,

add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ).

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

Example:

If the vector has [1, 2, 3]

the returned vector should be [1, 2, 4]

as 123 + 1 = 124.

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return a list of integers
    def plusOne(self, a):
         numbstr= [str(i) for i in a]
         wholenum = int(''.join(numbstr)) + 1
         outp = [int(i) for i in str(wholenum)]
         return(outp)
