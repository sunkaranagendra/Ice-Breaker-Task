A robot is located at the top-left corner of an A x B grid
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked ‘Finish’ in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Input : A = 2, B = 2
Output : 2

2 possible routes : (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) 
              OR  : (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1)
              
solution:
int nCr(long long int n, long long int k)  
{  
int res = 1;  
if ( k > n - k )  
    k = n - k;  
for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i){  
    res *= (n - i);  
    res /= (i + 1);  
} 
return res;  
}
int Solution::uniquePaths(int A, int B){
int x;
if(A < B)   x = A;
else    x = B;
return nCr(A + B - 2,x - 1) ;
}
